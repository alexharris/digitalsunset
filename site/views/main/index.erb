        <p><strong>What is worth looking at?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>If you take a cell phone pic of the sunset, does that make it less special? What if you send that cell phone pic to your coworker, or your sister, or the person you want to be your boyfriend, does that make it more special?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>If you look at the sunset, will it hurt your corneas?<br>
                                Will it hurt you psyche?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Is this notetaking or souvenir gathering?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>If photographs are experience captured, what is a cell phone pic of a sunset?</strong></p>
